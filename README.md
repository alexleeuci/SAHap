## Building

You need [Meson](https://mesonbuild.com/) and GCC 8 or above to build the project. Run the following to obtain an executable:

```
meson build
cd build
ninja
```

Don't have Meson? All the [cool kids](https://mesonbuild.com/Users.html) are using it and you are missing out! Follow [the guide](https://mesonbuild.com/Getting-meson.html) to get started.
