1) To make a new genome sequence, follow this format:

	python3.6 makeGenome.py polidy genome_length > fileForGenome

for example:

	python3.6 makeGenome.py 3 50 > testGenome1

2) To make a new read based off a genome, follow this format:

	python3.6 makeReads.py fileWithGenome number_of_reads end_reads min_gap max_gap 0.01 > fileForReads

for example:

	python3.6 makeReads.py testGenome1 100 5 19 23 0.01 > testReads1
